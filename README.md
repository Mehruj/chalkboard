Davron Ochilov: This assignment greatly developed my abilities in web design, I was able to create a wireframe with a proper layout, flow and functionality. With my partner's insights I created a wireframe on pen and paper with many different components that I thought were neccesarry for the creation of the website. We went over the term project requirements and made sure our website would fit most of the future criteria.
